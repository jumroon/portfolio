      About Me
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Hey there! Thanks for visiting my webpage. I'm an aspiring software developper and licensed medical doctor. I'm interested in the intersection between medicine and technology and how technological advances can be used to standardize health-protocols, reducing human-related medical errors and improving health-care outcomes. I'm always looking for med-tech projects to work on so feel free to contact me if you have a relevant project :). I'm also always improving my skills so hit me up if you'd like to code together!
